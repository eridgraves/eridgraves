Hello! I'm a software engineer at a company designing SSD testers used in engineering and production environments: [Neosem Technology](www.neosem.com).  I work on custom embedded Linux kernels and drivers, and do some C# WPF GUI work also! 

Previously, I worked at an ATE startup designing testers for RF front end modules: [Merlin Test Technology](www.merlintest.com).

If I find time to do other code-related projects, you can find them here on GitHub.

[Here](https://eridgraves.github.io/) is my personal website.
