Previously, I worked at as a software engineer designing SSD testers used in engineering and production environments: [Neosem Technology](http://www.neosem.com) and at an ATE startup designing testers for RF front end modules: [Merlin Test Technology](https://www.merlintest.com).

If I find time to do other code-related projects, you can find them here on GitHub.

[Here](https://eridgraves.github.io/) is my personal website.
